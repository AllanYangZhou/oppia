 - generatedParser.js: this is a parser automatically generated using PEG.js,
 that is responsible for parsing number with unit expressions. To change it, make updates
 to static/js/tools/input_to_PEG.txt and then paste the contents of this file
 into http://pegjs.majda.cz/online. Call the parser variable 'numberWithUnitInputParser'
 and check "use results cache". Then download the code and paste it into the
